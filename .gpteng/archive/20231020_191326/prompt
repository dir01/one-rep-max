A simple utility for strength training: calculating 1 rep max and several N-rep max values based on weight and reps input.

Application is going to be hosted on github pages, so no backend and no build steps:
pure html, css and js, zero dependencies, no frameworks, no libraries, prefereably only 3 files, but not a requirement.

An interface is going to be clean, lightweight and simple:

A header is always present on the page, it says [ 100 ]kg 1RM, where 100 is a weight input field and kg is a weight unit selector.
One row is also always present, it says [ XXX ]kg [10]RM, where XXX is a calculated weight and 10 is a reps input field.
There is also ability to add more rows, so user can calculate several N-rep max values at once.
Each field can be changed, and all other fields are recalculated automatically.

Interface is mobile-first, but operates well on desktops too.

All user preferences, values, etc are stored in local storage, so they are preserved between sessions.
