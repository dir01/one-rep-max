# One-Rep-Max
This is a small calculator for strength training.

**[dir01.github.io/one-rep-max](https://dir01.github.io/one-rep-max/)**

## What does it do exactly?
It tells you what is weight you can theoretically lift once given that you can lift some other weight some other amount of times before you reach muscle failure.

It also tells what weight you will have to pick to reach failure after 30, 20, and 10 reps (those are configurable).

## Why would you want this info
An app that I use to train, [RP Hypertrophy App](https://training.rpstrength.com/), proposes the following scheme for a warmup:

> - Do your 30 rep max for 12 reps, rest a minute.
> - Do your 20 rep max for 8 reps, rest a minute.
> - Do your 10 rep max for 4 reps, rest a minute.

And I usually only know how many times I was able to lift certain weight last time with what <abbr title="Reps In Reserve">RIR</abbr>
